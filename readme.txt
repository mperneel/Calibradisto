Calibration of distortion -> Calibradisto
Calibradisto is software to annotate real world straight lines in images, which appear to be curved in images due to radial lens distortion.
Based on these annotations, the parameters of a radial distortion model can be determined. Based on such a radial distortion model, images can be undistorted.
